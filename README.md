# pokemon_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## A hobby project to learn Flutter and Riverpod

  - This project is a simple Pokemon app that fetches data from the PokeAPI
  - The app displays a list of Pokemons and their details
  - The app uses Riverpod for state management and GetIt for dependency injection
  - The app uses the Dio package for network requests

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
